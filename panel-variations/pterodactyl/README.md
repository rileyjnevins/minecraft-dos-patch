# Pterodactyl (Wings) Botnet Patch
> This specific patch applies to the Pterodactyl panel. Pterodactyl uses docker to create containers for new servers. A feature this panel lacks is the ability to limit network capabilities, like they do CPU and memory. Bad actors can take advantage of this in a shared hosting environment for DDoS attacks.
